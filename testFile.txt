A 14-year-old boy who said he escaped from two kidnappers in Ohio claims he is from Illinois, where he went missing nearly eight years ago when his mother apparently took her own life.

According to police in suburban Cincinnati’s Sharonville, the boy said he had “just escaped from two kidnappers” he described as white men with body builder-type physiques.
